 ELT Pipeline with Snowflake, DBT, and Airflow  This project demonstrates how to build an ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) pipeline using cutting-edge tools such as Snowflake, DBT, and Airflow. By leveraging these technologies, we efficiently load and transform data to create robust, scalable data models for business insights.
